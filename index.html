    <h1>Andrija Stankovic</h1>
    <p>Hello. My name is Andrija and I'm a design student at TU Delft interested in exploring the connection between mobility and design. I consider myself as someone who learns best by taking action on how to solve the problem. I also consider myself as transparent and as a good-listener who is always willing to hear what other team members have to say about their visions. Moreover, as I am always trying to see things in a different light, I challenge others with my perspective in order to facilitate creative discussion.</p>
